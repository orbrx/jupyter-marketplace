A community-run marketplace for JupyterLab extensions. It surfaces real-world signals from PyPI (via BigQuery) and GitHub‚Äîstars, recent updates, and download trends‚Äîto make discovery less guessy.

## Quick start (local dev)

Prereqs: Node.js 18+, pnpm (or npm/yarn)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orbrx/jupyter-marketplace.git
cd jupyter-marketplace
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit env values, then:
pnpm dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Environment variables

The Supabase database is **publicly accessible** for read-only operations. You can use the live database directly for development, or connect to it for data exploration and analysis:

Create `.env.local`:

```bash
# Public Supabase client (read-only access)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://mijujdykpaerevemuznw.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1panVqZHlrcGFlcmV2ZW11em53Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTU2MzE1MTQsImV4cCI6MjA3MTIwNzUxNH0.5MuKbZsCEYGCqcRY9RFkwpHc1-o2G8V9ebR6WNrf5m0
```

## How it works (frontend)

- Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- Reads from a Supabase table/view exposed as a public, read-only API
- All filtering/sorting is executed server-side via Supabase queries
- No accounts; banner dismissal and a few preferences are stored in localStorage

The ingestion/data pipeline (BigQuery + GitHub enrichment + Supabase load) lives in a separate repo and is not part of this codebase.

## Dev notes

- Keep pages small and accessible.
- All new UI should work without JavaScript where reasonable (progressive enhancement).
- Please run `pnpm lint` before opening a PR.

## Accessibility

- Semantic headings and landmarks
- Focus-visible states on all interactive controls
- Keyboard support for search, sorting, and card actions
- If you spot anything we can improve, open an issue‚Äîaccessibility bugs are prioritized.

## Repo structure (frontend)
