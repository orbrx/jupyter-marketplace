# Contributing to JupyterLab Marketplace

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome contributions from the community.

## Ways to Contribute

There are two main ways to contribute to this project:

### 1. Frontend Development (This Repository)
- **Bug fixes**: Fix crashes, layout issues, or API errors
- **Feature development**: Add new sorts, filters, accessibility improvements, or UI enhancements
- **Code improvements**: Refactor components, improve performance, or enhance user experience

### 2. Data Issue Reporting
- **Data corrections**: Report incorrect package information, stale data, or mapping issues
- **Missing packages**: Report JupyterLab extensions that should be included
- **Feedback**: Use the "Report" links on extension cards or open GitHub issues

**Note**: This repository contains only the frontend code. Data ingestion and processing happens in a separate pipeline, so data-related issues are handled through feedback mechanisms rather than pull requests.
